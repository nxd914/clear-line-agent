Spot-price propagation latency arbitrage on Kalshi crypto binary contracts.

When BTC or ETH moves sharply on Binance or Coinbase, Kalshi's order book reprices seconds-to-minutes behind. Chiron measures that divergence with closed-form Black-Scholes N(d2) against Welford-estimated realized volatility, enters when edge exceeds the fee-adjusted threshold, and sizes positions with Kelly criterion.

No learned parameters. No heuristics. Every decision in the execution path is a deterministic function of spot price, realized vol, and the pricing model.

```

Seven async agents. No shared mutable state between agents — all coordination through typed queues and a read-only price cache. All models are frozen dataclasses.

## Pricing model

**Threshold contracts** (YES resolves if spot > K at expiry):

```
d2 = (ln(S/K) − 0.5σ²t) / (σ√t)
model_prob = N(d2)
```

No risk-free rate — prediction markets carry no financing cost. `σ` is 15-minute Welford realized vol, annualized. `t` is hours to expiry / 8760.

**Bracket contracts** ("ETH in [$L, $H]?"):

```
model_prob = [N(d2_floor) − N(d2_cap)] × BRACKET_CALIBRATION
```

`BRACKET_CALIBRATION = 0.55` — multiplicative haircut for TWAP settlement and discrete jump dynamics. See `docs/CALIBRATION.md`.

**Kelly sizing with fee adjustment:**

```
effective_price = ask + 0.07 × P × (1−P)   ← Kalshi parabolic taker fee
b = (1 / effective_price) − 1
f* = (p·b − (1−p)) / b
position = min(f* × 0.25, 0.10) × bankroll
```

## Risk controls

Every threshold is defined with its derivation in `core/config.py` and `docs/RISK_MODEL.md`.

| Control | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Kelly fraction cap | 0.25× | Absorbs model prob estimation error without ruin |
| Min edge | 4% | Covers Kalshi taker fee at worst-case spread |
| Max concurrent positions | 5 | 50% max capital deployed; leaves margin buffer |
| Max single exposure | 10% bankroll | Per-position concentration limit |
| Daily loss circuit breaker | 20% bankroll | Halt on correlated loss scenario |
| Consecutive-loss halt | 3 losses → 24h pause | Catches edge decay below percentage threshold |
| Max signal age | 2s | Stale signal = Kalshi already repriced |
| Max hours to expiry | 4h | Far-dated contracts don't face convergence pressure |
| Spread floor | 4% | No maker rebates on Kalshi; tight spread = edge gone |
| Burst cooldown | 30s between fills | Prevents correlated fill cascade from single signal |
| NO fill range | [0.40, 0.95] | Risk/reward bounds on NO-side positions |
| Symbol concentration | 2 per symbol | Caps correlated BTC/ETH exposure |

## Empirical status

Paper trading. 8 resolved fills to date — below the 20-fill minimum for Sharpe estimation. Live mode is gated in `core/config.py`:

```python
min_fills_for_live: int = 100     # minimum resolved paper fills
min_sharpe_for_live: float = 1.0  # rolling Sharpe over all fills
```

`EXECUTION_MODE=live` raises `NotImplementedError` until both conditions are met.
